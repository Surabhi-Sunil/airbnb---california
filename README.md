Use case:
Where can I buy a property in California and what type of property to put on Airbnb to get the most profit out of it.

Analysis:
- Renting an entire house/apartment makes the most money
- 1, 2, 3, and 4 bedroom places are the most common ones
- The apartments in East edna PL covina, east san gabriel, harbor city and los feliz neighborhoods make the least amount of avg. revenue
- beverly hills, and rancho palos verdes makes the most amount of money

To maximize profitability on Airbnb in California:

Focus on neighborhoods like Beverly Hills and Rancho Palos Verdes known for high rental revenues. Opt for entire houses or apartments, particularly with 1-4 bedrooms, as they attract higher-paying guests. Avoid areas like East Edna Pl Covina and East San Gabriel, which have lower average revenues. Ensure compliance with local regulations and consider professional management for efficient operations and marketing strategies.
